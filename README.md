# nextjs_blog
A blogging platform designed to integrate with github pages exclusively. Powered by Next.js, tailwindcss, and React.

Uses aceternity and shadcn components.

tailwindcss v3 because v4 breaks aceternity components that i probably wont even use, maybe upgrade soon

Builds and deploys automatically to GitHub pages via GH Workflows

Blog posts are uploaded in Markdown format to the /post directory in the project root.

Style is fully responsive. Works down to screen width of about 360px (very small/old mobile devices). Performance on old mobile devices is likely poor due to animations.
